# droid-observatory — Spec for the mission

Owner: David Carbajosa (architect, reviewer, the human in lane 7). Implementers: one Factory
Mission (orchestrator, workers, validators) under ai/RULES.md. Status: v0.1 approved by the owner
(2026-10-22); v0.2: §5.8 concurrency limits added (owner decision 2026-10-22); v0.3: amended
as-built at the S integration (2026-10-23, rule 8): §3 M0, §3 M4, §5.2, §8, §9, §10. Living document: §9 is the human feedback channel, §10 the as-built history.

Inputs: `ai/prd/droid-observatory-prd.md` (v0.5), `ai/prd/review-2026-10-22.md`, `ai/RULES.md`,
`ai/SPEC-TEMPLATE.md`, `docs/decisions/D-001..D-010`, `BACKLOG.md`, `config/observatory.example.toml`,
`config/prices/2026-10-22.toml`, `ai/session/2026-10-22-session.md` entries 17–21.

Approval boundary: this document is the contract the mission plans from. Until the owner answers
`approved`, nothing else happens: no milestone plan, no worktree, no application code, no GitHub
object. After approval the mission plans from this file only (rule 9: deviations are proposed with
reason and cost, and wait).

## 1. Purpose

**What it is.** A Rust desktop application (Tauri 2 shell, Leptos UI, `observatory-core` library)
that shows one Factory Mission moving through nine lanes (PRD §7): Intent, Orchestrator, Workers,
Validators-scrutiny, Validators-user-testing, Integration, Human, Outside, and Time/Waste/Cost/models.
Cards are milestones with their features inside (PRD §8); every lane entry is a view over the raw
JSONL line it came from, never a copy (PRD §11.2).

**For whom.** The mission owner who runs missions from a terminal and wants to see flow and cost;
the reviewer who opens Details and merges; the engineering lead who compares models over time
(PRD §6). Single user, local data, the user's own GitHub access.

**What it must prove.** The mission is done when all of these hold on the mission branch:

1. **Attach.** A mission started from any terminal on this machine appears on the board and every
   event of it shows within 1 s (FR-L1, FR-B6), with no control channel.
2. **Replay with a frozen mapping.** `observatory-cli replay` over the frozen capture ends with
   `unknown events: 0`, and the board renders the same capture with correct lane positions
   (FR-L2, FR-B7, rule 18).
3. **Host.** A mission launched from the app shows events within 1 s and the pause, message and
   answer controls reach the orchestrator (FR-L3, FR-H1..H4).
4. **Gate and fix loop.** Against the demo branch pair in this repository (§3 M4): a red check
   opens a `fix` cycle on the affected card, a green check with a human policy shows Merge, and
   merging from the app flips the badge (FR-G3..G8).
5. **Time, waste, cost.** Metrics recomputed from the frozen capture match the owner's reference
   spreadsheet within rounding (FR-M1..M7, PRD §10); every cost names its price-table date.
6. **The build is the first dataset.** The sessions of this mission are the capture that M0
   freezes and M5 is measured against (rule 17).

**Out of scope (explicit).** PRD §5 non-goals: planning inside the app, multi-user or server
deployment, writing to Factory's hosted API beyond what `droid` does, editing or reviewing code in
the app, CI systems other than GitHub Actions. Also out: CI telemetry to Grafana (B-002), a
dedicated error tracker (B-003), Linux and Windows bundles (macOS is the target; the devcontainer
is core-only, B-001), the app performing any merge other than the human-confirmed Merge button
(FR-G5): v1 never merges on its own. Observing a merge performed by a ruleset or a bot stays in
scope: the gate badge shows `policy-merged` on detection (FR-G6, M4). Also out: a second mapping
version for Droid releases newer than the one captured. Guard: the mapper is versioned from day
one, every `Event` carries `mapping_version`, and the unknown-event count is always visible (tray,
CLI summary, exported series), so the first Droid upgrade shows as a rising count, never as a
silently broken board. And out: migrating the backlog before the mission starts (entry 19).

**What this spec answers.** The review note `ai/prd/review-2026-10-22.md` item 5 (attach is the
primary live mode, D-008). The owner decisions logged after PRD v0.5: the telemetry contract and
series budget (D-010, B-017, §5.7), M4 on a demo branch pair in this repository instead of a
private demo repository (entry 19, B-007, §3 M4), the hybrid backlog driven by the mission
(entry 19, §8; withdrawn as-built, D-015), the orchestrator model id `claude-fable-5.1` (entry 21, D-006 correction, §2),
and the backlog items the spec session owns: B-005 (§6), B-010 (§3), B-014 (§7), B-017 (§5.7).

## 2. Mission setup

**Command** (run by the owner from the repository root on a checkout of `main` that contains this
approved spec; the mission creates `mission/observatory-v1` from it):

```sh
droid exec --mission --auto high \
  --model claude-fable-5.1          --reasoning-effort high \
  --worker-model claude-sonnet-5-5  --worker-reasoning-effort high \
  --validator-model claude-opus-5-5 --validator-reasoning-effort high \
  --output-format text \
  -f SPEC.md
```

| Flag | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `--mission --auto high` | required | Missions auto-approve proposals and need `--auto high` (Droid 0.247.0 `droid exec --help`). The hooks in `.factory/hooks.json` are the guard, not the prompt. |
| `--model` | `claude-fable-5.1` | Orchestrator (D-006, corrected 2026-10-22 from the misspelt `claude-fable-5-1`, which fell back to GPT-6 Sol). Factory catalog id, 4× multiplier. |
| `--reasoning-effort` | `high` | Fable's default; planning and integration are where judgment is bought. `xhigh`/`max` on a 4× model is not justified before a measured need. |
| `--worker-model` | `claude-sonnet-5-5` | Workers (D-006). 0.8× multiplier. Catalog id per docs.factory.com/models; `droid exec --help` on this machine lists `claude-sonnet-5` but not `claude-sonnet-5-5`; owner confirmed available on 2026-10-22. |
| `--worker-reasoning-effort` | `high` | Owner decision 2026-10-22: the model default; Rust compile errors and Leptos (little training data, PRD §12) need the reasoning. The cost/quality split lane 9 measures is between models, not efforts. |
| `--validator-model` | `claude-opus-5-5` | Validators, scrutiny and user testing (D-006). 1.6× multiplier. |
| `--validator-reasoning-effort` | `high` | Above Opus's default `medium`: validation is where correctness is bought (D-006 alternatives). |
| `--output-format` | `text` | The terminal is for the human; the dataset is the session JSONL under `~/.factory/sessions/`, which attach and replay read. |
| `-f SPEC.md` | this file | The mission plans from the approved spec (template, last paragraph). |

The same values are declared in `.factory/settings.json` so that a mission started from the
Factory App uses them: `missionOrchestratorModel`, `missionOrchestratorReasoningEffort`,
`missionModelSettings.workerModel`, `.workerReasoningEffort`, `.validationWorkerModel`,
`.validationWorkerReasoningEffort`. The three reasoning-effort keys are added with the spec PR
(§8). A change to any model is a decision file (rule 19).

**Mission branch.** `mission/observatory-v1`, created from `main` at the commit that contains this
approved spec. One pull request `mission/observatory-v1` → `main` at the end of the mission, opened
by the orchestrator, merged by the human after `gate` is green. Nothing else reaches `main`
(rule 12). The branch is deleted at the merge (PRD §2).

**Worktree policy.** One worktree per milestone: `git worktree add ../observatory-wt/<m> -b wt/<m>
mission/observatory-v1` where `<m>` is `s`, `m0` … `m5`. Workers and validators of a milestone
work only inside its worktree. Two worktrees never edit the same file (rule 13); the shared files
(`SPEC.md` §9–10, `README.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `docs/decisions/README.md`, `reports/`) are written by
the orchestrator on the mission branch at integration. Integration is `git merge --no-ff wt/<m>`
into `mission/observatory-v1` by the orchestrator, then `make check` locally, then the
`mission-checks` run on the push must be green before the next milestone starts. A worktree is
removed after integration; its branch stays (history).

**Gate command.** `make check` is the only local gate: it is exactly what `mission-branch.yml`
runs (rule 5). A worker hands off only with `make check` green in its worktree; the orchestrator
integrates only with `make check` green on the mission branch.

**Hooks that must be active.** `.factory/hooks.json`: `guard-git.sh` (PreToolUse on `Execute`,
blocks amend/reset/rebase/stash/force-push/push-to-main) and `log-tool-call.sh` (PostToolUse,
appends one JSON line per tool call to `build-log/<UTC-day>/<session>.jsonl`). Git hooks via
`make hooks` (`core.hooksPath=.githooks`): `pre-commit` (gitleaks on staged files, file size, debt
markers, decisions index, rustfmt, markdownlint), `commit-msg` (subject ≤ 72 chars, no WIP/fixup),
`pre-push` (no `main`, no non-fast-forward). A worker that finds a hook missing stops and reports;
it never disables or bypasses one (`--no-verify` is a rule 12 violation).

**Usage budget per milestone.** Unit: USD-equivalent at `config/prices/2026-10-22.toml`, computed
from the token counts Factory reports for the mission's sessions (the usage page or the stream's
`usage.reported`), pasted into `reports/usage/<milestone>.md` at integration (rule 7). Factory
Standard Credits are recorded next to it when visible. The caps below are the owner's planning
numbers, not measurements; this is the first mission and there is no prior run to calibrate on.
At the M0 boundary the orchestrator proposes re-caps for M1–M5 from the measured S and M0 usage
(owner decision 2026-10-22); until then the table stands.

| Milestone | Cap (USD-eq) | Reason for the size |
|---|---|---|
| S  walking skeleton | 40 | Thin slice, few files, mostly scaffolding and one fixture. |
| M0 capture and mapping | 60 | Mapper plus golden tests; the capture already exists (§3 M0). |
| M1 board, replay, attach | 150 | Largest UI milestone and the Leptos go/no-go; rework budget inside. |
| M2 host | 80 | RPC adapter plus launch screen; the control channel is new ground. |
| M3 intervention | 60 | Lane-7 semantics over M2 controls; small surface. |
| M4 branch, gate, fix loop | 120 | Two adapters (git, GitHub), the demo branch pair, a live PR loop. |
| M5 time, waste, cost | 120 | The metric engine and its oracle test; export; charts. |
| Total | 630 | Hard stop for the mission; the final PR and fixes come out of the unspent remainder. |

**Orchestrator cap (owner decision 2026-10-23, F-018).** The orchestrator is capped per milestone at
20 % of that milestone's cap, measured as the delta of its own session's `tokenUsage` (session
`e194b9e3`, not `inclusiveTokenUsage`) from the baseline recorded in `reports/usage/s.md`
(input 629 245, output 499 465, cache read 32 674 587, cache write 3 520 336; 83.44 USD-eq
mission-to-date), priced at the `claude-fable-5.1` row: M0 12, M1 30, M2 16, M3 12, M4 24, M5 24
USD-eq. The shares are re-set at the M0 boundary together with the milestone caps. Each
`reports/usage/<m>.md` shows the delta and records the new absolute `tokenUsage` as the next baseline.

At a cap the orchestrator stops dispatching, writes the usage so far to `reports/usage/`, raises
the stall flag and waits for the human (rule 15). Spending beyond a cap is a deviation (rule 9).

**What the human will answer mid-mission.** Only at a milestone boundary or when the stall flag is
up (rule 15): the M1 go/no-go (PRD §12), a budget cap reached, a proposed deviation from this spec
with its reason and cost, a keychain item or GitHub permission the mission cannot create itself
(§3 M4, §5.9), the reference spreadsheet for M5 (B-008), and a red `gate` on the final PR.

**What the human will not answer.** Style, naming, crate choice within §4, test structure, how to
split a milestone into features, which worker does what, or anything already decided here or in
`docs/decisions/`. Those go to the backlog with a reason or into a decision file (rules 13, 14).

## 3. Milestones

Seven milestones on the board of the build: the walking skeleton `S` first (rule 2), then
`M0`–`M5` in PRD §13 order. PRD §13 counts six; the seventh is the skeleton rule 2 requires, so
the PRD count is superseded here (rule 8). A milestone is integrated into the mission branch, never
shipped. The spec itself is not a milestone: it is approved before the mission starts.

**B-010 settled: skeleton before M0, and the capture is this mission.** Rule 2 wants the thinnest
end-to-end slice first; PRD §13 wants M0 to freeze the mapping before M1–M5 are planned in detail.
Both hold because the capture needs no extra mission: the moment the owner runs the §2 command, the
orchestrator's session JSONL is growing under `~/.factory/sessions/`, and the skeleton's workers
and validators add child sessions for every role. `S` replays a snapshot of that file through a
mapper that knows nothing yet (every line is `unknown.event`, counted). `M0` snapshots the same
sessions again at `S` integration, now with all four roles present, freezes it as the fixture,
and drives the unknown count to zero. The optional B-009 pre-capture is not needed; a small
sample-repo mission (PRD §13 M0) is the fallback only if role identification cannot be established
from this mission's own files.

**Common to every milestone.**

- Tests first (rule 1): each feature begins with a red test committed in the worktree; the
  scrutiny validator checks that the red run exists in the worker's log.
- Acceptance commands are the ones in §6 and `make check`; counts are pasted, not estimated.
- Exit needs: `make check` green on the mission branch after integration, `mission-checks` green
  on the push, zero blocking findings open, §9/§10 rows written, README/BACKLOG/decisions index
  updated (rule 16), `reports/usage/<m>.md` and `reports/readiness/<date>-<m>.json` added
  (B-015), and no `unknown.event` on the capture if the milestone adds a source (rule 18).
- Must not touch: `main`, another milestone's worktree, `rust-toolchain.toml` without a decision,
  the shared files (§2), the ruleset on `main`.
- Fixtures: `fixtures/streams/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.jsonl` is the orchestrator session; its child
  sessions live in `fixtures/streams/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.children/<session-id>.jsonl` with the
  `.settings.json` beside each. A fixture is committed only after `gitleaks detect --no-git` on the
  directory is clean and a reviewer has read it; raw lines may carry tool output.

### S — Walking skeleton

- **Outcome.** Cargo workspace with `crates/observatory-core`, `crates/observatory-cli`,
  `apps/observatory-app`; the canonical `Event` (PRD appendix A) with `EventKind::Unknown`;
  `observatory-cli replay <file>` reads a session JSONL and prints one line per event and the
  summary `unknown events: N`; the Tauri window starts and shows nine empty lanes with their
  names; `Cargo.lock` committed; `cargo deny` configured against `deny.toml`.
- **Tests green.** `replay_counts_every_line_of_a_capture()`,
  `unknown_event_keeps_raw_type_and_byte_offset()`, `event_round_trips_through_serde()`,
  `lanes_are_nine_in_prd_order()`, `cli_exits_nonzero_on_missing_file()`,
  `every_event_carries_the_mapping_version()`.
- **Acceptance commands.** `make check`; `cargo run -p observatory-cli -- replay
  fixtures/streams/2026-10-22-observatory-v1-s.jsonl` (prints `unknown events: N`, N > 0 allowed);
  `make app-dev` opens the window (screenshot in the validator report).
- **Gate.** `make check`, `mission-checks` green, `make deny` green, coverage reported (not yet
  enforced, §6).
- **Exit criterion.** The skeleton replays its own snapshot end to end from a clean clone with the
  README commands (rule 5); B-016 (`release.yml` checks the workspace version against the tag) is
  wired because `Cargo.toml` now exists; B-005 and B-014 jobs are in `mission-branch.yml`.
- **Must not touch.** No mapping beyond `Unknown`, no store, no metrics, no board interaction.

### M0 — Stream capture and mapping

- **Outcome.** `fixtures/streams/2026-10-22-observatory-v1-m0.jsonl` (+ children) frozen from this
  mission's sessions at `S` integration; `mapping::v1` from raw lines to PRD §7 kinds, selected by
  the Droid version in the fixture header `<capture>.capture.json` (session files carry no Droid
  version; usage, model, tags and child links come from the sibling `<id>.settings.json`, D-012);
  confirmation of where `--tag`, child sessions, roles, feature and milestone ids are recorded
  (PRD §11.1 open items), written to `docs/decisions/` and `library` of the fixture; SQLite store with the pointer index (§5.3);
  `observatory-cli replay` and `inspect <event-id>` (prints the raw line by pointer).
- **Tests green.** Golden tests `mapping_v1_matches_golden_lane_events()` (fixture → expected
  `.events.json`), `every_prd_kind_present_in_capture_is_mapped()`, `unknown_count_is_zero_on_m0_capture()`,
  `child_sessions_attach_to_their_parent()`, `roles_resolve_for_orchestrator_worker_and_both_validators()`,
  `store_pointer_reads_back_the_exact_raw_line()`, `mapping_version_is_selected_by_droid_version()` (reads `droid_version` from the fixture header).
- **Acceptance commands.** `make replay-fixtures`; `cargo run -p observatory-cli -- replay
  fixtures/streams/2026-10-22-observatory-v1-m0.jsonl` ends with `unknown events: 0`;
  `cargo test -p observatory-core --test mapping`.
- **Gate.** All of the common gate plus `unknown events: 0` on the M0 capture (hard).
- **Exit criterion.** The mapping is frozen (`mapping::v1`, versioned by Droid 0.247.x); PRD §7
  kinds that do not occur in the capture are listed in `docs/decisions/D-0NN-mapping-v1.md` as
  "defined, not observed". **This is the gate for planning M1–M5 in detail** (PRD §13).
- **Must not touch.** No UI beyond the empty lanes; no git/GitHub adapters; no metrics.

### M1 — Board in replay and attach

- **Outcome.** Board with nine lanes and milestone cards positioned by current lane (FR-B1), worker
  sub-lanes with the per-worker/per-feature toggle (FR-B2), filters (FR-B5), replay scrubber
  (FR-B6), unmapped tray (FR-B7); Details with the Timeline tab (FR-D1) opening raw lines;
  agent panel (FR-A1..A4) with `model.changed` and `context.compacted` markers. Attach: `notify`
  watcher on `[ingest].factory_sessions_dir` paired with the `jsonl_poll_ms` poll, startup scan of
  files already growing, tail on growth, render within 1 s, name by `--tag` or session id
  (FR-L1); replay is the same adapter at end of file (FR-L2). Read-only scrub pass before display
  (B-006) for the obvious token shapes, read-only rendering regardless. Mission library listing
  past missions with headline metrics (FR-L4; headline metrics arrive with M5, until then the list
  shows name, date, event count).
- **Tests green.** `card_sits_in_lane_of_most_recent_open_activity()`, `scrubber_replays_to_a_timestamp()`,
  `unmapped_tray_count_equals_unknown_events()`, `watcher_sees_a_new_session_file_within_poll_interval()`,
  `tail_renders_appended_lines_in_order()`, `attach_latency_under_one_second_on_fixture_replayed_live()`
  (a test harness appends the fixture line by line with timestamps), `name_prefers_tag_over_session_id()`,
  `scrub_masks_known_token_shapes_without_altering_the_store()`.
- **Acceptance commands.** `make check`; `trunk serve --port 3141` (browser host of the UI for the
  validators, §6); `make app-dev`; a mission started in a terminal appears on the board, each event
  within 1 s, measured by the attach-latency test and by the validator's timestamps.
- **Gate.** Common gate plus the **Leptos go/no-go** (PRD §12): the board renders the M0 capture
  (nine lanes, cards positioned correctly, Details timeline open) with at most 3 worker sessions
  of rework after the first scrutiny pass, and the Trunk/WASM build succeeds from a clean checkout
  with the README command. Fail → switch the UI to Tauri + TypeScript for M2 onward, core and the
  Tauri command boundary unchanged, decision file, owner approval.
- **Exit criterion.** Dogfooding starts: the rest of this mission is watched by attaching to its
  own session files (PRD §13).
- **Must not touch.** No hosting, no control channel, no GitHub.

### M2 — Host

- **Outcome.** Launch screen (FR-L3): repo, mission file, mission branch name, models and
  reasoning effort per role, autonomy, optional budget; spawn `droid exec --mission
  --input-format stream-jsonrpc --output-format stream-jsonrpc`; `RpcSource` adapter; pause,
  message, answer over the input channel; live output per agent (FR-A3).
- **Tests green.** `rpc_events_map_to_the_same_lane_events_as_the_session_file()`,
  `pause_request_is_written_as_jsonrpc_and_acknowledged()`, `answer_routes_to_the_open_question_id()`,
  `host_and_attach_of_the_same_mission_agree_on_event_count()`, `child_process_is_reaped_on_window_close()`.
- **Acceptance commands.** `make check`; from the app launch a short mission on a scratch
  directory inside the worktree; events within 1 s; pause/message/answer reach the orchestrator and
  its reaction appears; the same mission attached from its JSONL shows the same lane events.
- **Gate.** Common gate; zero `unknown.event` on the hosted capture (new source, rule 18).
- **Exit criterion.** PRD §13 M2 validation satisfied with the pasted event counts.
- **Must not touch.** Lane-7 semantics beyond logging the three controls (M3), GitHub.

### M3 — Intervention

- **Outcome.** Every control is a lane-7 event with the human as actor (FR-H1..H4: pause/resume,
  message, answer and approve/deny, mark complete/skipped); stall flag at
  `[intervention].stall_threshold_min` with the matching runbook prompt (FR-H5, `docs/runbooks/`);
  no nudging under threshold (FR-H6).
- **Tests green.** `each_control_emits_one_lane7_event_with_actor_human()`,
  `stall_flag_raises_after_threshold_of_no_active_time()`, `stall_flag_suggests_the_matching_runbook()`,
  `no_alert_for_waits_under_threshold()`, `mark_skipped_relays_as_an_instruction_to_the_orchestrator()`.
- **Acceptance commands.** `make check`; each action against a hosted mission produces the lane-7
  event and the orchestrator reacts (pasted event ids).
- **Gate.** Common gate.
- **Exit criterion.** `docs/runbooks/stalled-mission.md` app steps replace the CLI steps (B-012
  "revise at M3").
- **Must not touch.** GitHub, metrics.

### M4 — Mission branch, gate, and fix loop

- **Outcome.** `GitSource`: mission branch, milestone worktrees, integration commits, fast-check
  runs → lane 6 (FR-G1, FR-G2). `GitHubSource` behind the `Forge` trait: PR detection for
  `<mission branch>` → `<target branch>` (target parameterised, not hard-coded `main`), check runs,
  required checks, reviews, rulesets, attestations (FR-G3); merge policy with rule attribution and
  the `[github].merge_policy` override (FR-G4); gate group and badge in lane 8 (FR-B3); Merge
  button with confirmation naming PR and target (FR-G5); `policy-merged` on detection (FR-G6);
  CI red → `fix` cycle on the affected card(s), same PR, return arc (FR-B4, FR-G7); completion on
  merge and branch-deletion detection (FR-G8).
- **Test target (B-007 decided, entry 19).** A demo branch pair in this repository: long-lived
  `demo/base` created by the orchestrator from the mission branch; a ruleset `demo-gate` on
  `refs/heads/demo/base` (PR required, required check `demo-gate`, no force push); PRs from
  `demo/*` into `demo/base`; `.github/workflows/demo-gate.yml` on `pull_request` to `demo/base`
  (types `opened, synchronize, labeled, unlabeled`) that fails when the label `demo:red` is present
  and passes otherwise. Deterministic red and green, no `main` involvement, no second repository.
  The ruleset is created with `gh api` under the owner's token; if the token lacks admin, the
  owner creates it at the M3→M4 boundary (a human input, §2). Demo branches `demo/*` are deleted
  after each run; `demo/base` stays as test infrastructure and is listed in the README.
- **Tests green.** `pr_for_mission_branch_is_detected_within_poll_interval()`,
  `red_required_check_opens_a_fix_cycle_on_the_affected_card()`, `fix_cycle_keeps_the_same_pr()`,
  `merge_button_shows_only_when_policy_is_human_and_checks_are_green()`, `rule_attribution_names_the_ruleset()`,
  `policy_merged_detected_without_human_action()`, `gate_command_runs_are_lane6_events_attributed_to_the_milestone()`,
  `target_branch_is_read_from_config_not_hardcoded()`.
- **Acceptance commands.** `make check`; `demo/red-1` PR with `demo:red` → check fails → card
  loops to lane 3 with cycle count 1; label removed → check passes → Merge visible when policy
  allows → with the read-only token (D-014) the app surfaces the `403` cleanly (message naming the
  PR, the target and the missing permission; no crash, no retry storm) → the owner merges (UI or
  API) → badge updates from the poll → `demo/red-1` deleted. All run ids and PR numbers pasted.
  The question of a write-capable token for the Merge button stays at the M3→M4 boundary.
- **Gate.** Common gate; zero `unknown.event` from the git and GitHub sources (rule 18).
- **Exit criterion.** PRD §13 M4 validation satisfied on the demo pair; the decision file for the
  demo branch pair is written (the PRD §13 M4 row, §14 risk row and BACKLOG B-007 are already
  reworded in the spec PR, entry 19).
- **Must not touch.** The `main` ruleset, `main` itself, metrics.

### M5 — Time, waste, cost

- **Outcome.** Time-state engine (PRD §10.1), rework windows (§10.2), mission overhead (§10.3),
  cycle, waste, bottleneck, fix loops (§10.4), tokens and cost with the dated price table and
  credits when exposed (§10.5), budget meter (FR-M6), model comparison (FR-M7), CSV/JSON export,
  Details tabs Cost and waste (FR-D6), Review notes (FR-D2), Validation criteria (FR-D3), Commits
  and integration (FR-D4), Gate (FR-D5); lane 9 panel with SVG charts (stacked bars, timeline,
  sparkline); Grafana export of the §5.7 series behind `[telemetry].enabled`.
- **Oracle (B-008).** `reports/reference/2026-10-22-observatory-v1-m0.csv`, produced by the owner
  by hand from the M0 capture before M5 starts: per feature and per milestone, cycle seconds,
  first-pass active seconds, waste seconds by cause, rework windows, tokens by class, cost at
  `config/prices/2026-10-22.toml`. Rounding tolerance: 1 s on durations, 1 token, 0.01 USD.
  Missing at the M4→M5 boundary = stall flag, human input (§2).

- **Acceptance commands.** `make check`; `cargo run -p observatory-cli -- metrics
  fixtures/streams/2026-10-22-observatory-v1-m0.jsonl --csv` diffed against the reference within
  tolerance; with the keychain item present and `[telemetry].enabled = true`, series appear in the
  owner's Grafana stack with only the allowed labels (screenshot pasted).
- **Gate.** Common gate; oracle test green (hard).
- **Exit criterion.** All six "must prove" items of §1 hold; the orchestrator opens the single PR
  `mission/observatory-v1` → `main`, the `gate` runs, the human merges, the branch dies.
- **Must not touch.** Anything that changes the frozen mapping or the M0 fixture.

## 4. Versions

All checked on 2026-10-22 against the official source named (rule 3). "Pinned" means in the
repository today; "candidate" means the version a worker pins on the day it adds the dependency,
re-checking the source then (rule 3) and running `make deny`.

Runner labels `ubuntu-latest` / `macos-latest` float by design (GitHub-hosted); the Tauri bundle
job records the runner image version in its log (rule 7). Renovate (D-005) proposes updates; a
version bump on the mission branch is a worker change with `make deny` green, not a decision.

## 5. Architecture

Each decision carries its reason. Numbers come from the PRD and `config/observatory.example.toml`
unless a reason says otherwise.

### 5.1 Crates and interfaces

| Crate / app | Responsibility | Public interface | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `crates/observatory-core` | ingest, model, mapping, store, metrics, control, telemetry; **no UI dependency, sync, no tokio** | `Source` trait, `Event`, `Store`, `Metrics`, `Control`, `Config` | Testable from fixtures alone; every milestone's logic lives here so the UI can be swapped (PRD §12 go/no-go). |
| `crates/observatory-cli` | headless `replay`, `inspect`, `attach --watch`, `metrics --csv` over core | `observatory-cli <cmd>` | Rule 2: the first thing that works; rule 5: what CI runs; the validators' oracle for every milestone. |
| `apps/observatory-app` | Tauri 2 shell (`src-tauri`) + Leptos CSR UI (`src`) | Tauri commands and events, serde types imported from core | One language, no bindings drift (PRD §12). Commands are the only boundary the UI crosses, so a TypeScript UI could replace it without touching core. |

Tauri commands (M1 onward): `open_replay(path)`, `list_sessions()`, `attach(session_id)`,
`event_raw(ptr)`, `host_launch(cfg)`, `host_control(cmd)`, `metrics(scope)`, `gate(mission)`,
`merge(pr, target)`, `telemetry_status()`. Events from shell to UI: `events_appended(batch)`,
`session_discovered`, `stall_flag`, `gate_changed`. Batches flush every 100 ms (reason: well under
the 1 s requirement, avoids one render per line).

### 5.2 Canonical event and lane mapping

`Event`, `ReworkWindow`, `Lane`, `Role`, `EventKind` as in PRD appendix A; `EventKind` has one
variant per PRD §7 kind in `CamelCase` plus `Unknown { raw_type }`. `source: SourcePtr::Jsonl {
path, byte_offset, byte_len }` (appendix A has `path, byte_offset`; `byte_len` is added so a line
can be read without scanning for the newline) is the only thing the store keeps of a raw line
(PRD §11.2: the lane is a view). `mapping_version: MappingVersion` is a second addition to
appendix A: every `Event` names the mapper that produced it, so the first Droid upgrade shows as a
rising unknown-event count against a known version, never as a silently broken board (owner,
entry 23). Mapping is a module `mapping::v1` with a `MappingVersion`
selected from the Droid version in the fixture header `<capture>.capture.json` (`droid_version`,
written from `droid --version` at capture; a live attach records it in the `captures` row), because
the session files carry no Droid version (D-012). Usage (`tokenUsage`, `inclusiveTokenUsage`,
`childInclusiveTokenUsageBySessionId`), model, reasoning effort, tags (objects `{name, metadata}`)
and child links are read from the sibling `<id>.settings.json`. Unknown Droid versions use the
latest mapping and raise a one-line warning (reason: an old capture must keep replaying, rule 18
covers the rest). A mapping version is frozen at M0 and never edited; a later Droid release gets
`mapping::v2` and its own fixture. The golden file `fixtures/streams/<capture>.events.json` is the
contract of a version.

### 5.3 Store schema

SQLite via `rusqlite` with the `bundled` feature (reason: core is sync, a desktop index needs no
async driver, and bundling removes the system-library dependency from the clean-clone rule).
File: `~/.droid-observatory/observatory.sqlite` (schema version table, migrations forward-only).

| Table | Columns (keys) | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `sessions` | `id`, `path`, `droid_version`, `tag`, `role`, `parent_id`, `mission_id`, `started_at`, `ended_at` | One row per JSONL file; `tag` confirmed in M0 |
| `events` | `id`, `session_id`, `mission_id`, `milestone_id`, `feature_id`, `lane`, `kind`, `raw_type`, `mapping_version`, `role`, `model`, `at`, `duration_ms`, `path`, `byte_offset`, `byte_len` | Pointer, never payload |
| `usage` | `event_id`, `input`, `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_write`, `credits` | From `usage.reported` |
| `missions`, `milestones`, `features` | ids, names, `defined_at`, `completed_at`, `state` | Board model |
| `rework_windows` | `feature_id`, `opened_by`, `closed_by`, `cause` | PRD §10.2 |
| `prs`, `checks`, `attestations`, `reviews` | GitHub ids, state, `observed_at`, `url` | Lane 8 |
| `human_actions` | `id`, `kind`, `target`, `at`, `payload_ptr` | Lane 7 |
| `prices` | `effective`, `model`, `class`, `per_m`, `source` | Loaded from the dated TOML |
| `mapping_versions` | `version`, `droid_version_range`, `frozen_at` | §5.2 |

Raw lines are read on demand from `path`+`byte_offset`; if the file moved, the UI says so and
shows the pointer (reason: never copy raw lines, PRD §11.2).

### 5.4 Ingest adapters behind traits

```rust
pub trait Source { fn poll(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<RawRecord>>; fn kind(&self) -> SourceKind; }
pub trait Forge  { fn pr(&self, branch: &str, target: &str) -> Result<Option<Pr>>;
                   fn checks(&self, pr: &Pr) -> Result<Vec<Check>>; fn policy(&self, target: &str) -> Result<MergePolicy>;
                   fn merge(&self, pr: &Pr, method: MergeMethod) -> Result<Merged>; /* attestations, reviews */ }
```

`JsonlSource` (attach; replay = the same source at end of file with a clock the scrubber drives),
`RpcSource` (host, M2), `GitSource` (M4), `GitHubSource: Forge` (M4). Reason: one adapter for
attach and replay removes a whole class of "works in replay, not live" bugs (D-008); the `Forge`
trait is the seam for other forges later (PRD §5 non-goal, §11.2).

### 5.5 Config keys with defaults

Everything in `config/observatory.example.toml` as committed (`[mission]`, `[ingest]`, `[github]`,
`[intervention]`, `[metrics]`, `[telemetry]`), with these additions the mission makes, each with
its reason in the file (rule 4):

| Key | Default | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `[ingest].max_watched_sessions` | 64 | Bounds file handles and tail threads on a laptop; beyond it the newest are watched and the UI says how many are not. |
| `[ingest].max_session_file_mb` | 512 | Larger files are indexed but tail reads warn; protects memory on runaway sessions. |
| `[ingest].tail_chunk_kb` | 1024 | Read size per tail step; one chunk per poll keeps latency under 1 s at typical mission output rates. |
| `[ui].event_batch_ms` | 100 | Shell→UI flush interval (§5.1). |
| `[ui].dev_port` | 3141 | `trunk serve` port for the browser host used by validators (§6); chosen outside common dev ranges, confirmed free at planning. |
| `[store].path` | `~/.droid-observatory/observatory.sqlite` | One index per user; raw lines stay where Droid wrote them. |
| `[telemetry].max_milestone_labels` | 8 | 7 named milestones of this mission plus one `overflow` value; bounds the `milestone` label for any observed mission (§5.7). |
| `[telemetry].mission_switch_min_interval_min` | 30 | The exported mission changes at most twice an hour, so two missions' series never count as active together (§5.7). |
| `[telemetry].buckets.mission_cycle_seconds` | `[3600, 7200, 14400, 28800, 86400, 172800]` | Missions run hours to days. |
| `[telemetry].buckets.feature_cycle_seconds` | `[600, 1800, 3600, 7200, 14400]` | Features run minutes to hours. |

### 5.6 Metric definitions

By reference, not restated: time states PRD §10.1, rework windows §10.2, mission overhead §10.3,
cycle/waste/bottleneck/fix loops §10.4, cost §10.5. Closed cause lists used by the engine and the
exporter: **waste causes** `waiting_human_question`, `waiting_human_permission`, `waiting_merge`,
`waiting_validation`, `rework`, `retry_failure`, `idle_queued`, `idle_unscheduled` (8);
**rework causes** `scrutiny`, `user_testing`, `integration`, `gate` (4). Mission overhead is a
separate line in the app and is not exported (reason: it belongs to no card and D-010 has no label
for it). The CSV export has one row per feature with every §10.4 measure and the price-table date.

### 5.7 Telemetry series budget (D-010, B-017)

Contract: OTLP `http/protobuf` to `https://otlp-gateway-prod-eu-west-2.grafana.net/otlp`; header
value only from the keychain item `droid-observatory/otlp-headers`; resource attributes
`service.name=droid-observatory`, `service.version`; labels only from `mission`, `milestone`,
`role`, `model`, `cause`; counters and histograms only; one mission exported at a time.

| Metric | Instrument | Labels | Cardinality (worst case) | Series |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `observatory.mission.cycle_seconds` | histogram, 6 buckets | `mission` | 1 × (6 + `+Inf` + `_sum` + `_count`) | 9 |
| `observatory.feature.cycle_seconds` | histogram, 5 buckets | `mission` | 1 × (5 + 3) | 8 |
| `observatory.waste_seconds` | counter | `mission`, `milestone`, `cause` | 8 milestones × 8 causes | 64 |
| `observatory.rework_windows` | counter | `mission`, `milestone`, `cause` | 8 × 4 | 32 |
| `observatory.fix_loops` | counter | `mission`, `milestone` | 8 | 8 |
| `observatory.tokens.{input,output,cache_read,cache_write}` | 4 counters | `mission`, `role`, `model` | 3 roles × 4 models = 12 pairs × 4 | 48 |
| `observatory.cost_usd` | counter | `mission`, `role`, `model` | 12 | 12 |
| `observatory.unknown_events` | counter | `mission` | 1 | 1 |
| **Total worst case** | | | | **182** |

Expected for this mission (7 milestones, 3 role×model pairs): 9 + 8 + 56 + 28 + 7 + 12 + 3 + 1 =
**124**. Both are strictly under 200. Why these shapes: the feature-cycle histogram carries no
`milestone` label because a histogram per milestone (7 series each) would cost 56 series for a
distribution the app already shows per card; waste and rework keep `milestone` because the budget
meter and the waste chart are read per card. Guards: the `milestone` label is bounded by
`max_milestone_labels` (the ninth and later milestones of any observed mission export as
`milestone="overflow"`); `role` is the closed `Role` enum; `model` beyond four distinct values per
mission exports as `model="other"`; the exporter refuses to start if its computed worst case for the
configured buckets and limits is not under `[telemetry].max_series`, and the test
`exported_series_count_is_under_budget_on_worst_case_labels()` pins the 182. Series of a previous
mission stop being written when the export target changes; `mission_switch_min_interval_min` keeps
the two sets from overlapping inside Grafana's active-series window. A `service.version` change
(release) re-keys the resource once; it is not a steady-state cost. CI telemetry stays deferred
(B-002). D-010 sized the shape at up to 6 milestones; this spec uses 8 label values because the
skeleton makes seven milestones and one `overflow` value bounds other missions. Still under 200.

### 5.8 Runtime limits

From §5.5: 64 watched sessions, 512 MB per session file before warnings, 1 MiB tail chunk,
100 ms UI batch, 500 ms JSONL poll, 30 s GitHub poll, 15 s metric export, 20 min stall threshold.
The UI holds at most the visible window of events; everything else is a store query (reason: a
mission can emit tens of thousands of lines; the board must stay at 60 fps on a laptop). The host
child process is reaped on window close (M2 test). No network access except GitHub (when a token
is present) and the OTLP gateway (when enabled); both are shown in a status bar.

Validation and build concurrency (measured 2026-10-22; source:
`reports/readiness/2026-10-22-validation-readiness.md`):

- At most 3 concurrent agent-browser validator sessions per `trunk serve` (1.34-1.54 GB RSS each,
  CPU negligible idle).
- `cargo llvm-cov` runs alone (1-min load 3.3 → 14.6 on 10 cores during the scratch run).
- All cargo builds serialize on the shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` lock
  (`Blocking waiting for file lock on build directory`).
- `trunk serve` and `cargo tauri dev` coexist only when exactly one trunk owns port 3141.
- Cold `trunk serve` 55.94 s, incremental 1.46-2.08 s, `cargo tauri dev` to running app 37.66 s.

### 5.9 Security

- Secrets only from the macOS keychain or the environment (rule 4): `droid-observatory/github-token`
  or `GITHUB_TOKEN` for lane 8; `droid-observatory/otlp-headers` for telemetry (no environment
  fallback in the app, D-010). Never in config, store, logs or the exported telemetry.
- Raw JSONL is rendered read-only after the B-006 scrub pass, never uploaded, never copied into the
  store (PRD §11.2); rendering read-only and the merge as the one outward write are PRD §11.3.
  Fixtures are committed only after gitleaks and a human read (§3).
- The one outward write is the merge (FR-G5): confirmation names PR number and target branch;
  the app uses the repository's allowed merge method; the action is a lane-7 event.
- Telemetry carries no session id, event id, feature id or free text (D-010); the label allow-list
  is enforced in code and by test.

## 6. Tests

Fixtures are captured streams, named and dated (§3). Local = `make check` in a worktree; MB = the
`mission-checks` aggregate on `mission/**`; PR = the `gate` aggregate on the final pull request.

| Suite | Covers | Where | Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit (`#[cfg(test)]` next to code) | model, mapping helpers, time-state engine, windows, cost, label allow-list | local, MB, PR | `cargo test --workspace --all-features` |
| Fixture replay (`crates/observatory-core/tests/replay_*.rs`, `mapping.rs`) | each fixture → golden lane events, `unknown events: 0` on frozen captures | local, MB, PR | `make replay-fixtures`; `cargo test -p observatory-core --test mapping` |
| Attach latency (`tests/attach_latency.rs`) | harness appends a fixture line by line; event visible to the store within 1 s | local, MB, PR | `cargo test -p observatory-core --test attach_latency` |
| CLI (`crates/observatory-cli/tests/cli.rs`) | exit codes, `unknown events: N` line, `inspect` prints the exact raw line | local, MB, PR | `cargo test -p observatory-cli` |
| Metrics oracle (`tests/oracle.rs`, M5) | engine output vs `reports/reference/*.csv` within tolerance | local, MB, PR | `cargo test -p observatory-core --test oracle` |
| Telemetry budget (M5) | worst-case series count = 182 < 200; labels outside the set rejected | local, MB, PR | part of unit |
| UI logic | view-model functions (card position, filters, scrubber) live in core and are unit-tested there; the Leptos layer holds no logic worth a wasm test runner (reason: `wasm-bindgen-test` adds a toolchain step for little coverage) | local, MB, PR | part of unit |
| Interactive QA (validators) | board, Details, tray, filters, scrubber in the **browser host** `trunk serve --port 3141` with the fixture opened through the file picker; attach, host, controls and gate in the **Tauri window** (`make app-dev`) with screenshots and the CLI as oracle | per milestone, by the user-testing validator | `make app-dev`; `trunk serve --port 3141` |
| Coverage (B-005) | `observatory-core` lines | S: reported; **M0 onward: fail under 80 %**; MB and PR | `cargo llvm-cov -p observatory-core --fail-under-lines 80` |

**As-built (D-022).** On the Linux runner the unit and fixture suites run for `observatory-core` and
`observatory-cli` only (`cargo test -p observatory-core -p observatory-cli --all-features`); the
Tauri shell crate is linted and tested by `make check` locally and compiled by the macOS bundle job
(B-024). Fixtures are redacted at capture and `make redact-check` (part of `make check`) proves a
second redaction pass changes nothing (D-020, rule 22).

**B-005 settled: 80 % lines on `observatory-core`.** Reason: core holds every piece of logic that
can be wrong silently (mapping, time states, cost), so it is where coverage buys correctness;
IO adapters that need a live `droid` or GitHub are in core too and cannot all be exercised in CI,
which is the 20 % of room. The CLI is thin and covered by its own tests without a threshold; the
UI crate is excluded (wasm target, no logic). Enforced from M0 integration because S has too little
code for a percentage to mean anything. Raising it is a backlog item with a reason, lowering it is
a decision file.

## 7. CI

Two workflows, one required check (D-003). Measured per run; the wall time of the aggregate is
pasted into `reports/ci/<date>-<milestone>.md` at integration (rule 11).

**Mission branch** (`mission-branch.yml`, on push and PR to `mission/**`; aggregate
`mission-checks`; budget 3 min warm): markdownlint, lychee, actionlint, file size, debt markers,
decisions index, gitleaks, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test`,
`make replay-fixtures`, `cargo deny check`, plus from S: **`cargo machete`** (B-014) and
**`cargo llvm-cov` with the §6 threshold** (B-005). Independent jobs in parallel with the
rust-cache. Gates integration: the orchestrator waits for green before the next milestone. If the
warm time exceeds 3 min after the coverage job joins, coverage moves to the final PR only, by
decision file.

**As-built (D-022).** The Linux `rust` job installs no apt packages and does not build the Tauri
shell: `make fmt-check`; `cargo clippy --workspace --exclude observatory-app --all-targets
--all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::cognitive_complexity`; the wasm32 clippy of
`observatory-ui`; `cargo test -p observatory-core -p observatory-cli --all-features`; `make
replay-fixtures`. The apt variant took 4 min 24 s and 4 min 50 s, over the 3 min budget.
`mission-branch.yml` also runs on push to `wt/**`. Measured: run 39928967884 on the integration
commit, wall time 2 min 56 s (`reports/ci/2026-10-23-s.md`).

**B-014 settled: `cargo-machete`, not `cargo-udeps`.** Reason: machete runs on the stable toolchain
in seconds; udeps needs nightly, which is a second toolchain to pin and cache for a check that
finds a strict superset only in edge cases. Revisit if machete misses a real unused dependency.

**Demo gate** (`demo-gate.yml`, M4, on `pull_request` to `demo/base`): one job that fails when the
label `demo:red` is present. Required by the `demo-gate` ruleset on `demo/base` only. Never touches
`main`.

**Final pull request** (`gate.yml`, on PR to `main`; aggregate `gate`, the only check the `main`
ruleset requires): everything above plus Semgrep (SARIF to code scanning), Trivy filesystem scan of
the repository (vuln, misconfig, secret; HIGH and CRITICAL; `Cargo.lock` is what makes the vuln
scan meaningful), Checkov on the workflows, SBOM (`syft`), the macOS Tauri bundle (`bundle.yml`)
with build provenance (`attest-build-provenance`) and cosign signatures, Trivy results and SBOM
attached as artifacts. It never deploys. `release.yml` on `v*` tags pushed by the human to a
commit on `main` reuses `bundle.yml` and, from S onward, checks the workspace version against the
tag (B-016, wired in S; D-009).

## 8. Deliverables

Grown at every integration, never written at the end (rule 16).

- **README.md**: what it is, the clean-clone commands (`make doctor`, `make check`, replay,
  `make app-dev`), the mission command of §2, the gate, the demo branch pair, honest time and
  usage per milestone (rule 10, from `reports/usage/`), what was left out with the reason.
- **docs/decisions/**: one file per decision, `make decisions-index` regenerates the README. The
  mission writes at least: mapping v1 and the `--tag`/child-session findings (M0), coverage
  component and threshold (S), machete (S), series allocation (M5 or earlier), demo branch pair
  superseding the private repo (M4), backlog is `BACKLOG.md` only (S, D-015; the hybrid backlog was
  withdrawn), any model or effort change (rule 19; D-018: models are invariant), and the M1 go/no-go
  outcome. Written at the S integration: D-012 session schema, D-013 keyring variant B, D-014
  read-only token, D-015 backlog, D-016 coverage, D-017 machete, D-018 invariant models.
- **BACKLOG.md** (the only backlog; owner comment on the mission proposal, 2026-10-22, D-015):
  deferred items are `B-NNN` rows with a reason and an earliest milestone, written by the
  integration feature from the workers' handoffs. No GitHub issues, no `backlog` label and no
  `scripts/gen-backlog.sh` exist. *As built:* the hybrid backlog of the first version of this
  section (issues labelled `backlog`, regenerated `BACKLOG.md`) is withdrawn. Items the spec closed
  (B-005, B-007, B-010, B-014, B-017) are marked done with this spec as the reason. The wording of
  rule 14 in `ai/RULES.md` (the owner's file) still names the issues; the proposed wording is
  "everything else goes to `BACKLOG.md` with its reason", waiting for the owner.
- **build-log/**: one JSON line per tool call per session, written by the PostToolUse hook,
  committed with each integration (exempt from the 200 KB limit).
- **ai/session/**: one entry per interaction with transcript links; the mission appends to
  `ai/session/2026-10-22-session.md` (or a dated successor) at every boundary.
- **reports/**: `usage/<m>.md` (tokens, credits, USD-eq per role and model, pasted),
  `waste/<m>.md` (from M5 onward, computed by the observatory on its own capture),
  `readiness/<date>-<m>.json` (B-015, every integration), `ci/<date>-<m>.md` (aggregate wall time),
  `reference/` (the owner's spreadsheet, B-008).
- **Spec PR** (before the mission): this file, the model-id corrections already in the working
  tree (entry 21), the three reasoning-effort keys in `.factory/settings.json`
  (`missionOrchestratorReasoningEffort = "high"`, `workerReasoningEffort = "high"`,
  `validationWorkerReasoningEffort = "high"`), session log entries 20–23, the PRD §13 M4 row and
  §14 risk row reworded to the demo branch pair, and BACKLOG B-007 reworded (entry 19), on a
  `docs/spec-v1` branch, PR to `main`, merged by the human. Reason: the mission command reads
  `SPEC.md` from the branch it starts on, and `main` is the only branch a mission starts from (§2).

## 9. Changelog and human feedback

Written by the orchestrator on the mission branch, never in a worktree.

| Id | Date | Feedback | Applies | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-001 | 2026-10-22 | Orchestrator model id is `claude-fable-5.1`, not `claude-fable-5-1` (fell back to GPT-6 Sol) | §2, D-006, settings, README, config, price table | done (spec PR) |
| F-002 | 2026-10-22 | M4 is tested on a demo branch pair in this repository, not a private repo (B-007) | §3 M4, §7 | in spec |
| F-003 | 2026-10-22 | Hybrid backlog is fine, the mission drives it | §8 | withdrawn by F-014 (4): `BACKLOG.md` only, D-015; rule 14 wording awaiting the owner |
| F-004 | 2026-10-22 | Telemetry contract (D-010): labels, instruments, under 200 series | §5.7 | in spec (182 worst case) |
| F-005 | 2026-10-22 | Reasoning effort high/high/high | §2 | done (spec PR) |
| F-006 | 2026-10-22 | Automatic merge out of scope, observing a policy merge in scope | §1, §3 M4 | done (spec PR) |
| F-007 | 2026-10-22 | Mapper versioned from day one, unknown count always visible | §1, §3 S, §5.2, §5.3 | done (spec PR) |
| F-008 | 2026-10-22 | Spec reaches the mission via a spec PR to main (docs/spec-v1) | §2, §8 | done (spec PR) |
| F-009 | 2026-10-22 | Rule 14 wording change approved | §8, ai/RULES.md | done (spec PR) |
| F-010 | 2026-10-22 | Budget caps 630 accepted; re-cap proposed at the M0 boundary | §2 | done (spec PR) |
| F-011 | 2026-10-22 | claude-sonnet-5-5 confirmed available | §2 | done (spec PR) |
| F-012 | 2026-10-22 | SPEC.md v0.1 approved; mission plans from it | all | approved |
| F-013 | 2026-10-22 | Owner answers before the mission (entry 26): "Schema: agreed. Record droid --version in the fixture header as the mapping-version signal, read the sibling .settings.json for usage and child links, decision file at S integration, and amend the SPEC as-built at that integration (rule 8), not now."; keyring-core + apple-native-keyring-store accepted with a decision file; DMG only in the CI bundle job; Tauri evidence is the validators' smoke check plus one owner screenshot per integration; concurrency limits accepted; GitHub token read-only, check results from Actions runs and commit statuses | §3 M0, §5.2, §5.8, D-012, D-013, D-014 | done (as-built at the S integration) |
| F-014 | 2026-10-22 | Owner approval of the mission proposal (entry 27), with four comments: (1) "Budget vs plan: 630 USD-eq total against a Max month (and the 5-hour/7-day limits) will likely hit throttling mid-M1 or M4. State what happens at a throttle (pause at the boundary, no silent model downgrade) and keep the M0 re-cap step."; (2) "M4 acceptance contradicts my decision: it reads \"merge from the app → badge updates\". Make the M4 exit: Merge button visible when policy allows, the app surfaces the 403 cleanly with the read-only token, and the merge happens by me(UI or API); the badge updates from the poll. Write-token question stays at the M3→M4 boundary."; (3) "Reasoning effort: §8 says \"all high\"; the spec sets workers to medium. One or the other."; (4) "Backlog: \"hybrid backlog (gh issues labelled backlog)\" reopens the Issues question you closed yesterday; AGENTS.md says deferred work goes to BACKLOG.md, not Issues. Pick BACKLOG.md only, unless you want Issues back on purpose." | §2, §3 M4, §8, D-014, D-015 | (1) in mission files, M0 re-cap kept; (2) done, §3 M4 amended; (3) checked, all `high`, no change; (4) done, §8 amended, F-003 withdrawn |
| F-015 | 2026-10-23 | Owner decision at the S to M0 boundary: the models and reasoning efforts defined at mission approval never change for the lifetime of the mission; at a usage limit the mission stops, never continues on a fallback model | §2, D-018, `ai/RULES.md` rule 20 | done (as-built at the S integration) |
| F-016 | 2026-10-23 | Owner decision at the S to M0 boundary: communication. "Think as much as you need, say little. To the human: one line of status per milestone event, a decision request in three lines (what, options, your recommendation) when rule 15 requires one, and nothing else." | D-019, `ai/RULES.md` rule 21, `.factory/output-styles/mission-terse.md` | done (second S integration pass); the owner selects the style with `/settings` |
| F-017 | 2026-10-23 | Owner decision: PII in fixtures. Redact emails and `/Users/dct` paths deterministically, originals outside the repo with both SHA-256 in the decision file, offsets against the redacted file, gitleaks before commit, every future fixture | D-020, `ai/RULES.md` rule 22, S fixture redacted (`92d2208`) | done; open point: the hyphenated `-Users-dct-code-...` form (M0 to M1 list) |
| F-018 | 2026-10-23 | Owner decision: orchestrator cap, 20 % of each milestone cap, measured as the delta of session `e194b9e3`'s own `tokenUsage` from the baseline in `reports/usage/s.md`; re-set at the M0 boundary | §2 | done (as-built); re-cap at M0 boundary |
| F-019 | 2026-10-23 | Owner confirms D-011 with two addenda: BSL-1.0 is the Boost Software License (not Business Source); RUSTSEC-2024-0436 ignored with a re-check date 2027-01-21 | D-011 | done |
| F-020 | 2026-10-23 | Owner decision: the tool-call hook logs a `script` field (first 200 characters of `tool_input.script`) | D-021, `.factory/hooks/log-tool-call.sh`, B-022 | done (verified: 300-character payload logs length 200, other tools log null) |
| F-021 | 2026-10-23 | Owner: `.capture.json` `reviewed_by` stays `factory-droid[bot]` | S fixture capture header | done (no change) |
| F-022 | 2026-10-23 | Owner approves the rule 14 wording "everything else goes to `BACKLOG.md` with its reason" | `ai/RULES.md` rule 14, D-015 | done; F-003 and F-009 fully closed |
| F-023 | 2026-10-23 | Owner: keep `ai/prd/review-2026-10-22.md` (restored with `git checkout`); §1 unchanged | §1 | done (no edit needed) |
